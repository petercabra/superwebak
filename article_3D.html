    <h1>3D revolucia</h1>

        <p>3D printing is the process of printing a solid object from a digital model by printing many
            separate layers of the object. In recent years, this technology has developed enough to
            perform crucial roles in many fields. Nowadays, 3D printers are used at home, in design, food,
            medical, automotive and many other industries. 3D printing is getting more popular every day,
            because of its huge advantages. I have been working with 3D printers and other CNC machines
            for about three years now, and I see that it is becoming much easier to use these tools for
            beginners. This means that 3D printing is getting ready to become mainstream.
            Advantages of 3D printing</p>
        <p>This technology, as a part of additive manufacturing, allows designers to create
            prototypes at lower cost than by processes of subtractive manufacturing (CNC router,
            lathe).</p>
        <p>Well-designed parts can be printed with almost no waste, compared to the subtractive
            manufacturing when there can be as much as 99% of material that you are subtracting
            from, turned to waste.</p>

        <p>Subtractive vs additive manufacturing [2]</p>

        <p>Speed at which parts can be produced compared to other manufacturing processes. It is
            matter of uploading a CAD model and printing it in few hours. In the past, it may have
            taken even weeks to make a prototype from scratch. When the prototype was missing a
            feature or had design fault, it took weeks to come with fixed prototype and the cost of
            development got quickly up. Using of 3D printers means that designers can produce final
            product at lower cost and quicker.</p>
        <p>3D printers are easy to use. Many times, it is just matter of finding best temperature for
            the printed material and optimal quality from the chart, choosing how much detail there
            needs to be (higher detail means longer printing caused by machine printing thinner layers
            and printing at slower speed to avoid resonation) and then hitting the start button.</p>
        <p>Possibility to make crucial components in the field, or in some remote places like
            International Space Station or villages in third world countries. Using of 3D printer on
            ISS is saving millions of euros when anything breaks and possibility to make any kind of
            fitting needed to get water to the village or making prosthetics for injured is convenient.
            Disadvantages of 3D printing</p>
        <p>Accuracy is big problem in 3D printing because prototypes usually need to be precise in
            order to be sure that the part is feasible. There usually has to be room for +/-0,1mm error.
        <p>It is very inefficient to print high number of same parts which could be made by moulding
            or thermoforming in matter of minutes, not hours like 3D printing.</p>
        <p>With the increasing size of build plate, cost goes as high as many hundreds of thousands,
            or even millions of euros. This is unrealistic option for many companies. </p>   </div>
